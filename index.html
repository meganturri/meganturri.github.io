title: GEOG5003 - Assessment 1 Model
---


This model contains an Agent Based model that represents the movement and interaction of herbivours (e.g. sheep) with the envrionment and other agents. 
It allows for random movement and takes into acount communication between themselves and with the surrounding envrionment.
The envrionment is represented through a text file containing  raster dataset presented as Comma Seperated Varibles (Envrionment. txt).
When the envrionment data has been read in it can be plotted (https://github.com/meganturri/meganturri.github.io/blob/main/plot_envrionment.png) as well as to add spatial reference.
The order of agents was randomised to create a more realistic model. 
The additon of the seperate OOP (agentframwork.py) allows for a cleaner code that is easier to read and understand. This included defining the agent in repsepct to the envrionment as well as the the agent behaviours: move, eat and share with neighbours and the calculation for distance ebwteen each agent.


The model is then displayed as an animation using (matplotlib.animation).
